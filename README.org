* generator-jshint
  A Yeoman generator for [[http://jshint.com/][JSHint]] configuration files. This will *only*
  add/overwrite =.jshintrc= in the current directory (so you can run it on
  existing projects to add/overwrite that file).
** Usage
   Install:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# install yeoman if you haven't already:
npm install -g yo

# install the generator:
npm install -g generator-jshint
#+END_SRC
   Run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
yo jshint
#+END_SRC
   You'll be asked a series of questions that are all used to configure
   [[http://jshint.com/][JSHint]]. You can find the [[http://jshint.com/docs/options/][full list of JSHint options]] on its site, and [[https://github.com/jshint/jshint/blob/master/examples/.jshintrc][an
   example =.jshintrc= file]] on GitHub. Issues with this generator can be
   reported [[https://github.com/losingkeys/generator-jshint/issues][on GitHub]].
